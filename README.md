Zao et al Novel simian retrovirus replication phylogenetic analysis
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What`s this all about?
-------------------
This is a phylogenetics minireplication analysis based on a paper by Zao et al. 
*"A novel simian retrovirus subtype discovered in cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis)"*
The miniproject was created as an exercise in in [Bioinformatics Institute](https://bioinf.me/en)

Question under analysis
-------------------
Can the phylogenetic tree from the Zao et al. paper be replicated? Do the newly discovered SRV 
viruses hold their own distinct postion on the phylogenetic tree?

Objectives
-----------------
- Download SRV viruses sequences using eutils
- Align sequences using clustalw
- Draw a phylogenetic tree of SRV viruses
- Compare results from different differential expression analysis tools inside Hobotnica

Software used
